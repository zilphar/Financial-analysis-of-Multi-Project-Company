🧩 Project Overview

This project involved developing a comprehensive financial performance model in Power BI to assess revenue, cost, and profitability data across three projects (A, B, and C) over the fiscal years 2023 and 2024. The objective was to evaluate the business's financial health, identify loss-making segments, and recommend data-driven strategies for improving profitability.

# 💡 Key Skills Demonstrated
a.Financial Modeling

b. Power BI Dashboarding & DAX

c. Cost & Revenue Analysis

d. KPI Development

e. Profitability & Margin Analysis

f. Business Intelligence Storytelling

# 🔍 Modeling Scope & Objectives
a. Track and visualize total revenue, costs, and net profit by year, month, and project.

b. Break down COGS vs. Operating Expenses (OPEX) to understand cost structure.

c. Calculate profit margins, cost-to-revenue ratio, and project-level contribution to revenue and loss.

d. Use visuals (bar charts, KPIs) to communicate trends, outliers, and performance drivers.
